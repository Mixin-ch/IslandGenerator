## Custom islands in every world!
Unlock the power of customization with our Minecraft plugin!
With the ability to generate custom islands in every world, you have complete control over the min and max height, size, and even the type of island.
Choose from a variety of island types including grass, snow, sand, and ore.

Each island also comes with a chest containing loot of your choice, and a unique auto-generated name and description.

And now with our new feature, you can spawn a sphere around the island which is especially useful for water worlds. This feature allows you to create an island that stands out in water-based worlds, making it more immersive and interesting.

With unlimited possibilities and endless fun, our plugin is a must-have for any Minecraft enthusiast! Whether you're a seasoned pro or a new player, this plugin will enhance your Minecraft experience and give you the tools you need to create the worlds of your dreams.

## Tips

- Recommended to use in void worlds, but can also be used in others.
- On every island a chest will be spawned, which when clicked, will drop loot. The loot and also the multiplier can be modified via the config.yml.
- Should the server overload, try setting the `tickBuffer` in the config file to a higher number, to give the server the oppertunity to relax.
